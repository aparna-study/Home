		<h2>Facebook Addiction</h2>
		<p>Scientists have been investigating the idea of Facebook addiction for years now. In 2012, researchers from the
		University of Bergen conducted a first-of-its-kind study about the ways in which people develop Facebook dependency. 
		The social nature of the site itself was considered problematic, especially for women, extroverts, and those unable to 
		fall asleep until very late at night (people with a delayed sleep-wake rhythm), researchers said. The following year,
		researchers linked social media use to the reward center of the brain that's associated with preservation of our social 
		reputation, whereas another preliminary study found compulsive Internet use may induce changes in some brain reward
		pathways that are similar to drug addiction.

		<h2>Warning Signs or Characteristics of Internet Addiction</h2>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>Internet users, spent more than 25 hours/week on the Internet for non-school or non-work-related 
			activities and who reported Internet-associated health and/or psychosocial problems</li>
			<li> However, the Internet’s penetration into daily life is a serious problem for an increasing number of 
			people, rising to the level of Pathological Internet use (PIU) or Internet addiction (IA), and carrying 
			negative consequences similar to those of other behavioral addictions</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Reason to Overuse Social Sites Or Why Considered Addictive</h2>
			
		<p>
		Sadness and depression, boredom, and stress were common triggers of intensive Internet use. Social media use was nearly 
		universal and pervasive in participants’ lives. Sleep deprivation, academic under-achievement, failure to exercise and 
		to engage in face-to-face social activities, negative affective states, and decreased ability to concentrate were 
		frequently reported consequences of intensive Internet use/Internet overuse.

			<h2>SO, WHAT'S THE DANGER Or Side Effects?</h2>
			When people say 'gambling addiction', they really mean 'dopamine addiction' because it's dopamine that give people 
			the urge to continue gambling. In fact, a technology addiction is remarkably similar to a gambling addiction as you 
			have an ever-changing scenario of possibilities and opportunities for reward. Granted, you can't lose big money 
			from compulsively checking Facebook, but there are other pitfalls.Technology addictions can lead to: 
			<ul>
				<li>Increased stress-levels</li>
				<li>Shorter attention spans (especially in kids)</li>
				<li>Irregular sleep-patterns and poor sleep</li>
			</ul>
