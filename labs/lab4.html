 My Name is Aparna. I'm one of the millions of Art Lover and who likes to create something
  beautiful out of available things like papers, used moving boxes.<br>

 I like paper quilling,like to play ping pong and these days I have developed interests in long tennis.
Most of free time I spent in making some nice things out of quilling like earrings, flowers for 
wall decoration, nice photo frames all made of drawing paper etc.

<p style="text-align:left">
 Art is so vast that whenever I try to do something every time I create something 
new out of it. Anybody who would start doing it would not restrict themselves to do only 
<strong style="color:red"> Paper Qilling.</strong >
I used quilling in decorating other things made of paper along with decorating things made of quilling only.
I would like to share my ideas and would love to meet people sharing same interests learn from others 
experiences and ideas.
