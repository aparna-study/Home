		Sushi is a Japanese food consisting of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients , seafood,
		vegetables and sometimes tropical fruits. Ingredients and forms of sushi presentation vary widely, but the 
		ingredient which all sushi have in common is rice. 
		The term sushi comes from an archaic grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means 
		"sour-tasting", a reflection of its historic origin as a fermented food. The oldest form of sushi in Japan,
		narezushi, is still made by wrapping fish in soured fermenting rice, which causes the fish proteins to break 
		down into their constituent amino acids.

		<h2>HOw to Order Sushi</h2>
		<ul>
			<li> Pick Your Master Chef. Make no mistake: although sushi is often the main attraction in upscale 
			Japanese restaurants, there is lots of lousy sushi out there. ..</li>
			<li>simply say <strong>“omakase,”</strong> which means <strong>“I leave it to you.”</strong>  This allows the chef to serve what he
			considers to be the best neta in the order of maximum enjoyment.</li>
			<li>Ordering: The Three O's. ...chopsticks,  wasabi,  soy sauce. ..</li>
			<li>Seek out the specialties </li>
			<li> When in a traditional sushi bar, sashimi should be ordered before sushi </li>

			<h2>What are the ways that grocery store sushi is different from serious sushi?</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>It's too mushy... or too dry
				The rice is likely cooked with too much water, leading to an initial texture more akin to baby food. 
				But after a few hours in a cold case, that roll will be dry as a bone.</li>
				<li>The temperature is wrong: Sushi rice should be served close to body temperature and kept slightly 
				warm until being served. That's not happening in a grocery store.</li>
				<li>The flavor of the rice is off: Grocery store sushi rice is usually cooked with much more vinegar 
				and sugar, often a pre-mixed ratio, leading to more overpowering rice that attempts to make up for 
				less flavorful fish.</li>
				<li>The seaweed is just missing the point
					Traditionally, seaweed should be dry and a bit crispy compared to the roll's softer contents. Refrigeration and
					the mushier rice cause it to lose its texture.</li>
				<li>The wasabi isn't fresh (and might not even be wasabi)
					The spice and flavor of real wasabi disappears within 10 or 15 minutes of grinding, so there's no way you're getting the real stuff.</li>
