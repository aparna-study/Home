				<p>
				SAN FRANCISCO (KRON) — The Bay Area Council has released what it found to be the 
				top 5 issues concerning Bay Area residents, and the results may be surprising.
				The poll asked Bay Area residents to identify issues government leaders should focus on. Placing No. 1, 48 percent 
				believed the drought was the top concern, according to the poll.<br>
				Bay Area municipalities along with the rest of state are facing strict water restrictions that Governor Jerry Brown 
				approved several weeks ago. California is in the midst of a crippling 4-year drought.</p>
				<br>
				<p>The drought destroying California’s farmlands and parching its wells has another consequence: dirtier air. 
				Industrial cities in the Golden State are seeing higher levels of air pollution as a result of warmer, drier weather, 
				a trend that is undermining statewide efforts to clean up emissions from power plants and tailpipes.
				“Climate is playing a big role in the quality of air and impact on public health,” said Janice Nolen of the
				American Lung Association, in Washington. “As places have warmer temperatures, it’s harder to keep [pollution] under control.”	</p>

				<h2>My Opinion</h2>
					<p>We have to reduce excess water consumption now in such devastating draught certainly. In coming days we won't be able to afford 
					 housing cost and increasing water bills at one time.Also we should reduce shower timings because every drop counts.
