			<h2> Favourite Sport is Tennis</h2> 
			
			<dl>
			<dt>Tennis Rules</dt>
			<dd><li>The server must then serve each point from alternative sides on the base line. At no point must the server’s feet move in front of the baseline on the court prior to hitting their serve.</li>
			<li>If the server fails to get their first serve in they may take advantage of a second serve. If they again fail to get their second serve in then a double fault will be called and the point lost.</li>
			<li>If the server clips the net but the ball goes in the service area still then let is called and they get to take that serve again without penalty. If the ball hits the net and fails to go in the service area then out is called and they lose that serve.
			The receiver may stand where they wish upon receipt of the serve. If the ball is struck without the serve bouncing then the server will receive the point.</li>
			<li>Once a serve has been made the amount of shots between the players can be unlimited. The point is won by hitting the ball so the opponent fails to return it in the scoring areas.
			Points are awarded in scores of 15, 30 and 40. 15 represent 1 point, 30 = 2 and 40 = 3.</li><li> You
			need 4 points to win a game. If a game lands on 40-40 it’s known as deuce. From deuce a player needs to win 2 consecutive points to win the game. After winning one point from deuce they player is on advantage. If the player wins the next point they win the game, if they lose it goes back to deuce.</li></dd>

			<dt>My reasons to play Tennis</dt>
			<dd><li>ability to accelerate by practice in sprinting, jumping and lunging to move quickly.</li>
				<li>Powerful first step by requiring anticipation, quick reaction time and explosion into action.</li>
				<li>Speed through a series of side-to-side and up and back sprints to chase the ball.</li>
				<li>Leg strength and general body coordination since you have to move into position and then adjust your upper body to hit the ball successfully.</li>
