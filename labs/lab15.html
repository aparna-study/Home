			<p>The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the mile-wide, 
			three-mile-long channel between San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. 
			city of San Francisco, on the northern tip of the San Francisco Peninsula, to Marin County, bridging both U.S. 
			Route 101 and California State Route 1 across the strait. The bridge is one of the most internationally 
			recognized symbols of San Francisco, California, and the United States. Hopefully you'll hit it on a 
			clear day so you can see it in all its glory, but even shrouded in fog it's a magical sight. To get a
			real sense of its beauty or scale, walk or bike its 1.7-mile span.

				<h2 class="h2item3">Bixby Creek Bridge </h2>
				<img class="imgst" src="Bixby-Bridge.jpg" alt="Image of Bixby Creek Bridge" width="500" height="200" align="right">
				<p> Bixby Creek Bridge, also known as Bixby Bridge, is a reinforced concrete open-spandrel arch bridge in Big Sur, California. 
				   The bridge is located 120 miles (190 km) south of San Francisco and 13 miles (21 km) south of Carmel in Monterey County 
				   along State Route 1.
				   The bridge is “one of the most photographed features on the West Coast” due to its pleasing aesthetic design
				   and because of its location along the scenic Central Coast of California, and has frequently been used in 
				   automobile commercials. The bridge has become a regional landmark and was used in the opening sequences of 
				   the television series Then Came Bronson, the films Play Misty for Me and The Sandpiper.
