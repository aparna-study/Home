				   <h3>Flashlight is ultimate adventure gadget.</h3>
				  
				   <p>
				   Have peace of mind knowing you have a flashlight, GPS, and walkie-talkie with you wherever you go! Whether you're biking or hiking, fishing or hunting, 
				   navigating or camping. Some flashlight has as a GPS, walkie-talkie, compass, accelerometer, optical sensor, 
				   USB charger, text-messaging capability, distress beacon functionality, and more… all in one small aluminum cylinder.
				   The auto-dimming flashlight has a function that causes the light to flash if dropped on the ground, making it easy to find in the dark. 
				   There is a move-to-activate feature that makes finding you in a dark duffle bag a breeze. 
				   GPS — It is outfitted with a GPS system that lets a user set waypoints and destinations. A smartphone app allows you to mark points of interest 
				   from your smartphone via Bluetooth or USB, or navigate via the small builtin LED screen.
