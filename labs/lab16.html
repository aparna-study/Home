			 <h2>1. Viktor Ahn (RUS), Short Track Speed Skating</h2>
			<h3> Three gold medals, one silver medal in four events entered </h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				Ahn was one of the leading international stories going into the Games. He had won three golds and one bronze while 
				skating for South Korea as Ahn Hyun-Soo at the 2006 Olympics.Ahn did not qualify for the 2010 Olympics, and subsequent
				fallout with the Korea Skating Union led him to acquire Russian citizenship.He flourished with his new 
				nation in Sochi, astonishingly bettering his 2006 Olympic medal haul. Ahn was .077 away from becoming the 
				first person to sweep all four short track golds.He became the most decorated Olympic short track skater
				of all time, matching Apolo Ohno in medals but with more golds.South Korean fans were irate over his success, 
				especially compared with the South Korean men’s failure to win a medal.Ahn, 28, is considering the 2018 
				Olympics, which are in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

				<h2>2. Ireen Wuest (NED), Speed Skating</h2>
				<h3> Two gold medals, three silver in five events entered </h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				No nation was as dominant in an individual sport as the Dutch speed skaters. It was a team effort, but if one
				person must be singled out, make it Wuest.She won her second Olympic title in the 3000m and helped the Netherlands
				to its first Olympic medal in the women’s team pursuit, a gold.She also collected silvers in the 1000m, 1500m and 
				5000m, displaying the talent that’s made her the three-time reigning World Allround champion.Wuest, the most 
				decorated athlete at these Games, became the eighth athlete to win five medals at one Winter Olympics. It’s now
				been done at three straight Olympics, more commonplace with events being added to the program every four years.
				Wuest, 27, said before the Olympics that she was hoping to compete in 2018. She is two medals away from the 
				career Winter Olympic record for women.
